**Requirement**: 

To use the code, make sure you have installed Pymoo and Numpy. 

A MATLAB implementation by Eric is also available [here](https://github.com/EricZheng1024/CMA-ES), which is greatly appreciated. For short, 
* the [Python implementation](https://github.com/chandler09/1P1-MOEAD-CMA) is compatible with [Pymoo](https://github.com/anyoptimization/pymoo),
* the [MATLAB implementation](https://github.com/EricZheng1024/CMA-ES) is compatible with [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO).
